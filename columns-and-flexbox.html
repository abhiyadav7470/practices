            Along with HTML an CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main things of the www (World Wide Web). It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it.
            JavaScript is single threaded. This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly.
            Despite the fact that there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, respective standard libraries and syntax, these two languages are distinct and differ significantly in design.
            Like all other scripting languages, arrays and objects can be created with a brief shortcut syntax. These literals structure the basis of JSON data format.
            JavaScript supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provides a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.
            There is a CSRF attack known as “JavaScript hijacking” in which a tag on an attacker’s site damages a page on the victim’s site that returns private information such as JavaScript or JSON (Reference: Wikipedia)
            JavaScript is supported by all modern Web browsers with the built-in interpreters.
